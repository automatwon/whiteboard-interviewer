======================

Please read this guide on gitflow:
http://nvie.com/git-model/
We are probably not going to have hotfixes or release branches, but the master/develop/feature model is still really helpful.

When you are developing code or making any other change, make a feature branch (named feature/thing-i'm-doing) off of develop. Before you merge back into develop, please push your feature branch and open a pull request. Add at least one person whose opinion you think will be helpful to the request.
